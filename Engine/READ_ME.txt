The "Engine" project contains the code for each design pattern.

Engine project notes
=========================================
There is a folder for each pattern.
- If there is only a single code example for the pattern, it will be in this folder.
- If there is an example of how something might be done without the pattern, it will be in a sub-folder named "NonPatternVersion".
- Examples using the design pattern will be in sub-folders named "PatternVersion"
	- If there is more than one example of the pattern, there will be multiple sun-directories that start with "PatternVersion".


TestEngine project notes
=========================================
This is an MSTest unit test project. It has tests that show how the pattern could be used, for many of the patterns.

The directory structure matches the "Engine" project.
